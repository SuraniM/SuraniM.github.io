abstract = {ObjectiveMany individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 experience long-term symptoms as part of a syndrome called post-COVID condition (PCC). Research on PCC is still emerging but is urgently needed to support diagnosis, clinical treatment guidelines and health system resource allocation. In this study, we developed a method to identify PCC cases using administrative health data and report PCC prevalence and predictive factors in Manitoba, Canada.DesignCohort study.SettingManitoba, Canada.ParticipantsAll Manitobans who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during population-wide PCR testing from March 2020 to December 2021 (n=66 365) and were subsequently deemed to have PCC based on International Classification of Disease-9/10 diagnostic codes and prescription drug codes (n=11 316). Additional PCC cases were identified using predictive modelling to assess patterns of health service use, including physician visits, emergency department visits and hospitalisation for any reason (n=4155).OutcomesWe measured PCC prevalence as % PCC cases among Manitobans with positive tests and identified predictive factors associated with PCC by calculating odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (aOR).ResultsAmong 66 365 Manitobans with positive tests, we identified 15 471 (23%) as having PCC. Being female (aOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.58 to 1.71), being age 60–79 (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.41) or age 80+ (aOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.46 to 1.80), being hospitalised within 14 days of COVID-19 infection (aOR 1.95, 95% CI 1.80 to 2.10) and having a Charlson Comorbidity Index of 1+ (aOR 1.95, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.14) were predictive of PCC. Receiving 1+ doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (one dose, aOR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.86; two doses, aOR 0.29, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.31) decreased the odds of PCC.ConclusionsThis data-driven approach expands our understanding of the prevalence and epidemiology of PCC and may be applied in other jurisdictions with population-based data. The study provides additional insights into risk and protective factors for PCC to inform health system planning and service delivery.},
